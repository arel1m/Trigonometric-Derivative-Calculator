Trigonometric Derivative Calculator  

Overview  
The **Trig Derivative Calculator** is a Java program that computes the derivatives of trigonometric functions.  
It supports sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, and csc (positive or negative inputs).  
The goal of this project is to provide a quick and simple way to practice and verify derivatives of trigonometric functions.  

Features  
-Computes derivatives of six trigonometric functions  
-Handles both positive and negative values of functions  
-Outputs results in simplified form  

Installation & Usage  
1. Clone or download the repository  

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Trigonometric-Derivative-Calculator.git
   
2. Navigate into the project folder

   cd Trigonometric-Derivative-Calculator
3. Compile and run the program

   javac Main.java
