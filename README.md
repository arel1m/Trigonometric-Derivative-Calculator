# Trigonometric Derivative Calculator  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Trig Derivative Calculator** is a Java program that computes the derivatives of trigonometric functions.  
It supports `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `cot`, `sec`, and `csc` (positive or negative inputs).  
The goal of this project is to provide a quick and simple way to practice and verify derivatives of trigonometric functions.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Computes derivatives of six trigonometric functions  
- Handles both positive and negative values of functions  
- Outputs results in simplified form  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Java  

## 📂 Installation & Usage  
1. Clone or download the repository  
   ```bash
